# Getting Around Bangkok

Bangkok offers diverse transportation options for every budget and travel style.

The venue is a **5-minute walk from Punnawithi BTS Station (E11), Sukhumvit Line**, or a quick ride by Anywheel bike-share bicycle.

## Trains (Recommended)

Bangkok's rail network includes **BTS**, **MRT**, **ARL**, and **SRT**. These systems are modern, air-conditioned, and reliable, with fares typically ranging from **15–100 THB**. Routes are easy to navigate using Google Maps or Moovit. Operating hours are typically **6:00 AM – midnight**.

The **BTS Skytrain** is the most convenient way to travel around the city, avoiding traffic while connecting major areas.

### Payment Options

**EMV Contactless (Tap-to-Pay):** The **MRT**, **ARL** (Airport Rail Link), and **SRT** systems support EMV contactless payments — tap your Visa or Mastercard credit/debit card directly at ticket gates (look for the contactless wave symbol). This is the same tap-to-pay technology used worldwide.

**Rabbit Card:** Supported by lines operated by the BTS company, namely the **BTS** as well as the MRT Pink and Yellow lines (the MRT lines, but not the BTS, also support EMV). See the Payments page for more info.

**Cash/QR:** Otherwise, MRT and BTS stations provide ticket machines where you can buy one-time tickets with cash. Coins are always accepted, while only certain machines take banknotes – check to see if the machine has a banknote slot. Newer machines also accept QR code payments; BTS machines accept AliPay and WeChat Pay alongside PromptPay. If you cannot use the machines, you can also purchase tickets from the ticket counters.

For real-time updates, download the **BKK Rail App** (available on Google Play and the App Store).

## Bicycles

Bangkok's emerging cycling culture offers an intimate way to explore the city, featured by Forbes as one of the [best ways to explore Bangkok](https://stories.forbestravelguide.com/bangkoks-unexpected-outdoor-adventures). While dedicated bike lanes are limited, cycling reveals hidden galleries and local eateries off the main tourist paths. 

True Digital Park provides secure bicycle parking near Starbucks for private bicycles. 

Several bike-sharing services operate in central Bangkok:

- **[Anywheel](https://www.anywheel.co.th/)** (green bikes) — 10 THB per 30 minutes. Requires return to designated stations.
- **[Hello Punpun](https://www.facebook.com/hellopunpunbikeshare)** (blue bikes) — 10 THB per 30 minutes. Requires return to designated stations.
- **[GCOO](https://gcoo.io/)** (green e-scooters) — 3 baht per minute. Can be returned anywhere within the service area.

A map of bike-sharing station locations is available [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1uNuLkjtv_hm0DIIKNF8R2p8_WCJMtog&usp=sharing) (enable Pun pun and Anywheel providers when viewing).

### Cycling Safety

- Prioritize sidewalk riding on major roads, maintaining slow speeds and yielding to pedestrians
- Navigate through quieter side streets when possible — use the OsmAnd app for bicycle routing via side streets
- Note that trains accommodate only folding bicycles
- Stay well-hydrated in Bangkok's tropical climate
- Check air quality index (AQI) before cycling during hazy periods

## Buses

Bangkok's bus network is extensive and inexpensive, with routes available on Google Maps and Moovit. However, buses are affected by traffic conditions. Fares are usually paid in cash onboard, though EMV card payments are also accepted in buses run by the BMTA (as opposed to Thai Smile).

A bus stop with multiple routes is located **directly in front of the venue**. To see detailed information about bus routes, stops and real-time bus locations, download the **ViaBus** app.

## Tuk Tuk

These iconic three-wheeled vehicles come in two varieties: 

1. **[Muvmi](https://muvmi.co/)** — An app-based prepaid service offering comfortable rides with knowledgeable drivers that operate as a last mile provider
2. **Street-hailed tuk tuks** — catering primarily to tourists seeking thrilling city tours (always negotiate fares in advance)

## Canal Boats

Canal boats on the **Saen Saeb Canal** offer a fast and inexpensive way to travel across parts of the city. From **Petchaburi MRT Station**, boats provide access toward the old town area for **12–22 THB**.

## River Boats

The **Chao Phraya River** is another major transport route. From **Saphan Taksin BTS Station**, river boats connect destinations such as ICONSIAM, the Grand Palace, and areas north toward Nonthaburi.

## Ride-Hailing Services

Traffic in Bangkok can be heavy and unpredictable. **Travel times can vary dramatically—up to 15 times longer during peak hours compared to off-peak times—so exercise caution when planning time-sensitive journeys.** Commonly used apps include [Grab](https://www.grab.com/th/en/), [Bolt](https://bolt.eu/en/cities/bangkok/), [Tada](https://tada.global/), [LINE MAN](https://lineman.line.me/), and [InDrive](https://indrive.com/) with Grab being the most popular.

Motorcycle taxis (drivers wearing orange vests) and regular taxis are also widely available. When using taxis, always ensure the **meter is turned on**, and when using motorcycle taxis **always wear a helmet**.
