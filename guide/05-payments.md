# Payment methods

The predominant methods of payment in Thailand are QR codes and cash, used effectively everywhere from taxis to street food stalls to markets to malls. Credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, UnionPay) are generally used less often and are primarily accepted in more upscale establishments. There are also more niche domestic payment networks built on specific platforms, like True Corporation’s TrueMoney Wallet or the BTS’s Rabbit card.

Thailand’s PromptPay QR codes are a frontend to its bank transfer network and are accessed using mobile banking or e-wallet apps. While they have been widely adopted in recent years, there will still be a few situations where bank transfers are not accepted or are inconvenient, eg at stores that only accept transfers via TrueMoney Wallet, or when your phone is out of battery. There may also be other restrictions depending on the mobile payment app you use, and as such, having cash on hand is strongly advisable.

On the other hand, while you can often get by in Thailand with just cash, dealing with change will be inconvenient, and there are some places that only accept cashless payment – primarily self-checkout kiosks and select stores within malls. Usually cashless-only places will almost always accept card, so it is recommended you keep cash along with at least one cashless payment method: either a mobile payment app that supports PromptPay QR codes, or a credit/debit card.

## Options for cashless payment

The most convenient way to access QR code payments as a foreigner is to sign up for [Kasikornbank’s PAY & TOUR prepaid card][pay-and-tour], and to use it with the [**TAGTHAi Easy Pay**][easy-pay] e-wallet. Not only will you be able to use QR code payments, but you will also have a prepaid Visa card that can be used to withdraw cash at all ATMs and pay fares in most public transit systems. There are several drawbacks however: the TAGTHAi Easy Pay app is slow to load and to process a transaction, taking between 10 and 30 seconds to pay, and the app only supports paying to QR codes registered to shops, not individuals. Additionally, registration and top-ups can only be done with cash **in a foreign currency** at a dedicated KBank foreign exchange booth, not a KBank branch; these booths are found primarily in the airports and in foreign tourist hotspots. This forces you to use these booths’ exchange rates, which are highly unfavourable, even more so than the rates listed on KBank’s website and at its branches. You can expect to receive approximately 7% less Thai baht compared to midmarket rates. <!-- based on personal experience; booth at BKK sold ~39 THB for 1 GBP on 2025-12-16. -->
