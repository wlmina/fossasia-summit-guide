# Connectivity (eSIM & SIM Cards)

Staying connected in Thailand is affordable and easy. You have two primary options:

## Option 1: Travel eSIM (Recommended)
    
Skip the airport queues by activating an eSIM before you land.
  - **Providers:** Use apps like **Airalo**, **Nomad**, or **Saily**.
  - **Cost:** Plans typically start around **$5–$10 USD** for 10–50 GB of 5G data.
  - **Benefit:** Your home SIM stays in your phone, and you have data the moment you touch down.

## Option 2: Physical Tourist SIM
    
If your phone doesn't support eSIM, you can buy a physical SIM at a carrier store location (found in most malls and at the two airports) or any **7-Eleven**.
  - **Major Carriers:** **AIS** (widest coverage) and **True-dtac** (merged entity, excellent 5G in Bangkok).
  - **Registration:** You **must** present your original passport for registration at the time of purchase.
  - **Cost:** Expect to pay **299–699 THB** ($8–$20 USD) for "Tourist" packages lasting 8 to 15 days.
